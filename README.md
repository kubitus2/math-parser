# Mathematical expression parser

Simple math expression parser that takes into accoutnt order of operations. I made this to learn how scanners and parsers work. I intend to expand this in the future to learn more about compilers.

## Operations

* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Parentheses

## Todo

- [ ] Fix bug with negative numbers
- [ ] Add support for exponentaion, factorials etc.
- [ ] Better parsing
- [ ] General refactor
